# RSJ Reports

### OpCon Reports Directory

The opcon_reports directory is only available from SMA Technologies'. Symitar does not support the opcon_reports directory. 

After a job is run through RSJ, RSJ creates a directory in the following location:

```/SYM/SYMnnn/opcon_reports/jobfile ```

In place of "jobfile" is the name of the jobfile that was executed. Each batch output file and report file created by the job is stored in this directory. To help maintain those directories the following features have been added:

An OpCon job can be created to tar/zip this directory up and move the tar file to another directory for archival purposes. This will enable customers to go back to any day and see what succeeded/failed on that day.

A second OpCon job can be created to clean this directory every morning.

Links to the sequence number reports in the REPORT directory are made to the nested jobfile directory under the opcon_reports directory. Using links is a more efficient usage of disk space than creating a copy of each report.

### RSJ Report Naming

When Symitar jobs run, the reports created are placed in ```/SYM/SYM###/REPORT``` (the ### is the three digit SYM number). Each report file is named as a six digit number. 

There is one report file that is the "cross reference" between these sequence numbers and the report titles (as well as other information). This cross reference report is called the batch output file. 

:::info Note

The following batch output file shows the type of information available. 

The cross reference entries between report sequence numbers and report titles have been highlighted. 

This is not the entire file. The entire file is approximately two thousand lines long with normal jobs. 

This file can be in excess of ten thousand lines.
