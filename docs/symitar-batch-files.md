# Symitar Batch Files

## Symitar Control Files/Response File

Below is a Symitar Control File/Response File example. When the user enters the parameters for a Symitar batch file, the Symitar interface builds a response file. The file simply contains the "prompt" and the value entered by the user. A colon (:) is used to separate the prompt from the value.

## Symitar Batch File Program Commands

### @
* Default Value
* Interactively prompts for a response both in interactive and batch jobs. No RSJ job may contain a "@" symbol.

### !

* Default Value
* When program is being interactively executed, prompts user for response.
* When program is being run in a batch job, does not prompt user for response.

### @PREVSYSTEMDATE

* Prompts/does not prompt for previous processing date. 
* Users can add an optional numeric offset to the date: ```@PREVSYSTEMDATE-10```

### @SYSTEMDATE

* Prompts/does not prompt for today's processing date. 
* Users can add an optional numeric offset to the date: ```@SYSTEMDATE+10```

### @DATE(month,day,year)

* Uses current date. 
* Month – numeric, ranges from 1 to 12. This field can also contain THIS. THIS means use today's UNIX system date.
* Day – numeric, ranges from 1 to 31. This field can also contain THIS. THIS means use today's UNIX system date.
* Year – numeric, ranges from 00 to 99. This field can also contain THIS. THIS means use today's UNIX system date.
* Users can add an optional numeric offset to the date: ```@DATE(month,day,year)+10```

:::info Note

Typically, Symitar correctly processes the @PREVSYSTEMDATE, @SYSTEMDATE and @DATE commands in a job file. It is not necessary to change them to a "!".
